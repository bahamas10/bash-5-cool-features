# 5 Cool Bash Features to Impress your Friends

## Abstract

Bash is one of the most common shells you'll encounter in the wild (and probably
already on your laptop as the default). Last tech summit I covered 5 common
mistakes and pitfalls with bash. Now, I will cover 5 cool features about bash
that a user may not know about and will hopefully leave the listener with the
tools and knowledge to become more proficient at the shell.
